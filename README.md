# Project: Traffic Sign Classifier
This project is part of Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program. Tools, techniques and knowledge learned in class about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks were used to classify traffic signs.

### Overview
In this project, ConvNet architecture is used instead of a simple Feed Forward Network to classify traffic signs. The dataset to train are traffic sign imgaes from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 

### Dependencies
This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:
- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

Run this command at the terminal prompt to install [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). Useful for image processing:

- `conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3`

### Dataset 
Data set for this project can be downloaded from [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 
NOTE: Data set images used on this project have been already resized to 32x32. You may want to do that if you you are using different image size. 

### Get started
Clone the project and start the notebook.
```
git clone https://github.com/cuevas1208/Traffic-Sign-Recognition
cd Traffic-Sign-Recognition
jupyter notebook Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb
```
